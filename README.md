Product Recommendations for Monthly PetMind Subscription Boxes

**Context** 
PetMind is a nationwide pet product retailer in the United States. With inflation hitting 41-year
highs, the company is planning to reduce the cost of customer retention by improving brand
loyalty. The first strategy is to launch a monthly pet box subscription in three months.
The marketing team is preparing a list of popular products for the pet box subscription. The
chief marketing officer wants to know whether the list should only include the products being
purchased more than once.

**Questions**
The marketing team would like to answer the following questions to help with the decision:

* How many products are being purchased more than once?
* Do the products being purchased again have better sales than others?
* What products are more likely to be purchased again for different types of pets?

**Methodology**
After importing all my libraries and the csv file, I began my exploratory data analysis and validated the data based on my findings and the data dictionary. I continued to dig into my data for insights and used the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries, as well as Excel, to visualize my findings. Ultimately, I designed a PowerPoint presentation to exhibit my data analysis.

**Findings**
* The top 3 categories by sales are equipment, snack, and toys. They make up almost half (48%) of all sales. 
* Similarly, the top 3 categories by repurchases are equipment, snack, and toys. They also make up almost half (48%) of all sales.
* Although these categories were commonly repurchased across all pet types, medicine was repurchased more than toys for dogs.
* With a correlation coefficient of 0.98, there is a strong positive correlation between sales and repurchases. 

**Recommendations**
*Despite the frequency of medicine repurchases for dogs, I donâ€™t recommend including medicine in our boxes. Therefore, all pet boxes, even the dog boxes, should include snacks, equipment, and/or toys.
*Due to the strong positive correlation between sales and repurchases, products being purchased again have better sales than others. These repurchased products should be offered in the pet boxes.
